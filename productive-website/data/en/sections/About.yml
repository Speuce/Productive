      \n- Luke
        \n\t- The largest areas I feel to have grown over the course of this project are: code reviewing, android UI development, technical communications, and testing.
      \n- Trang
        \n\t- I have contributed mostly in UI development. Throughout this course, I have developed my communication skills (though still not so good), testing and learned more about architecture design and agile development.
      \n- Matt
        \n\t- I’ve contributed mostly to the backend, with the logic and persistence layer.  Through this project I’ve learned a lot about testing, having an end goal in mind, time estimation of large projects, and time management.
      \n- Farabi
        \n\t- I’ve learned that building a project is more than just throwing code at an IDE. Maintainability, planning, the ability to communicate your ideas clearly are all crucial. I’ve worked mostly on the UI layer and learned what makes it intuitive, and what it takes to support the UI functionalities.W
      \n- Ben
        \n\t- During the course of this project, I contributed mostly to business logic and testing. I have vastly improved my skills in testing and code design. I have also become better at team-based development and gained many skills in that area (communication, version control and documentation).
