Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project.
Provide links to the
feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit
that was used complete the feature.

Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

In the TaskManagerTest.java, we tested an the TaskManager's validation of the priority
field of a task.

In this specific code, we chose to go with a 'throw error if input data in invalid' approach.
The user will eventually be able to enter a custom value in for the 'priority' of a task.
In order to prevent the user from entering extraneous negative values, we do some validation in the logic layer
that the provided priority is not negative. If it is, an appropriate descriptive exception is thrown, that
later should be meaningfully displayed to the user.

Branching
----------

Provide a link to where you describe your branching strategy.

Provide screen shot of a feature being added using your branching strategy
successfully. The [GitLab Graph tool can do this](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-summer2019/cook-eBook/-/network/develop),
as well as using `git log --graph`.

SOLID
-----

Find a SOLID violation in the project of group `(n%12)+1` (group 12 does group 1).
Open an issue in their project with the violation,
clearly explaining the SOLID violation - specifying the type, provide a link to that issue. Be sure
your links in the issues are to **specific commits** (not to `main`, or `develop` as those will be changed).

Link to issue:
https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/umhub-7/-/issues/35

Agile Planning
--------------

Write a paragraph about any plans that were changed. Did you
'push' any features to iteration 2? Did you change the description
of any Features or User Stories? Have links to any changed or pushed Features
or User Stories.
